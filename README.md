Usage
Prepare the dataset:

Ensure you have a dataset of facial images categorized by emotion.
Update the dataset paths in the notebook.
Train the model:

Run the Jupyter notebook FaceEmotionDetectionUsingCnn.ipynb to train the CNN model on your dataset.
Evaluate the model:

The notebook includes code to evaluate the model's performance on a test set.
Model Architecture
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from input images. Multiple convolutional layers are used to learn complex patterns.
Pooling Layers: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, retaining the most significant information.
Fully Connected Layers: Perform classification based on the extracted features. Dense layers with dropout are used to prevent overfitting.
Output Layer: Uses softmax activation to predict the probability distribution over the emotion classes.
Results
The trained model achieves accurate emotion detection on the test dataset, effectively distinguishing between different facial expressions. Below are some key metrics:

Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy on the test set.
Loss: Maintained a low loss value throughout training.
Confusion Matrix: Demonstrated clear distinctions between different emotion classes.
